AlexNet is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that revolutionized computer vision by winning the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012. It was developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton, and it significantly improved image classification accuracy by leveraging deep learning techniques
# Key Features of AlexNet
- Deep Architecture: Consists of 8 layers (5 convolutional layers + 3 fully connected layers).
- ReLU Activation: Uses Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) to speed up training by preventing vanishing gradients.
- Dropout Regularization: Introduces dropout in fully connected layers to reduce overfitting.
- Overlapping Max Pooling: Uses max pooling with overlapping windows to downsample feature maps efficiently.
- Local Response Normalization (LRN): Normalizes neuron activations to improve generalization.
- Data Augmentation: Uses image translation and flipping to artificially increase dataset size.
- GPU Utilization: Designed for parallel computation on two GPUs for increased efficiency.
